Assignment 1 Resume Website
1. The project was completed without too many problems.  I used my sailing resume because that is my most professional resume and the industry I will be working in after college.

I designed it to be viewable on both an Iphone and a Computer.  Most of the style sheet for the iphone was kept the same but I made some of the fonts lighter to make it more readable.

2. There was no collaboration

3. 5 hours were spent on this project
