<h1>Solomon Krevans</h1>

<h2>Raised in Bethel, Alaska, Solomon started racing when he moved to Maine and joined the Mount Desert Island High School Sailing Team.  A two time state champion Solomon is a junior, sailing for the Tufts University Jumbos.</h2>
<h2>As a member of the 2012 Oakcliff Sapling class Solomon worked to expand his offshore and match racing experience. Highlights of his summer included the Newport to Bermuda Race, the Melges 32 World Championship, wins at the NYYC Annual Regatta and Queens Cup, and a variety of match racing events including a handful of podium finishes. The hard work continued into the fall when he won the ICSA Match Racing National Championship as main trimmer/tactician for the Jumbos.</h2>
<h2>Solomon will continue training at Oakcliff this summer with the added focus of the 2013 Farr 40 Worlds.</h2>
